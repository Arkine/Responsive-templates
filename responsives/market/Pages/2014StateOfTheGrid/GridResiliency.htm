                            <p>The electric grid sizzles all the time. In the blink of an eye anything from wildfires to unexpected equipment outages can alter the delicate balancing act of supplying enough energy to meet demand every minute of every day.</p>
                            <p>The ISO implemented on May 1, 2014 a new 15-minute scheduling option in its market.  This major technology enhancement allows renewable generators to schedule power in 15-minute intervals rather than hourly. This allows generators to better forecast how their plants will operate closer to the time when the electricity is needed and the ISO automatic systems to adjust accordingly when dispatching plants should run.</p>
                            <p>One big benefit is that renewable resources will be able to better contribute to balancing the grid, which is done every five minutes and thus help to support system reliability.  For instance, renewable plants can adjust their generation output to align with grid conditions, such as reducing production during periods of over-generation.</p>
                            <p>After the ISO began developing this scheduling enhancement, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued its <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2012/062112/E-3.pdf" target="_blank">Order No. 764</a><span class="nobr"> (PDF, 745KB)</span> with the requirement that all independent system operators develop a 15-minute scheduling option.  See our Order No. 764 compliance filing with federal regulators <a href="https://www.caiso.com/Documents/Nov27_2013_TariffAmendment-ComplianceFERCOrder764_ER14-495.pdf" target="_blank">here</a><span class="nobr"> (PDF, 2.9MB)</span>.</p>

                            <p>Maintaining reliability requires continuously matching the demand for electricity with supply.  Historically, the ISO directed conventional, controllable power plant units to increase or decrease output to follow fluctuations in demand. Higher levels of variable generation resources such as wind and solar present operational challenges to this second-by-second balancing act.  A tariff change in 2013 to comply with <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2011/102011/E-28.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order No. 755</a><span class="nobr"> (PDF, 371KB)</span> now enables the ISO to incent preferred, faster-starting resources by providing them with additional performance payments when they respond to automatic dispatch signals. This change furthers the ISOâ€™s ability to maximize the use of preferred resources in grid operations.</p>
                            <p>Longer term, the ISO and the California Public Utilities Commission are developing specific requirements for flexible generating capacity needed to integrate increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation into the ISO system. In early 2014, the ISO Board approved a proposed tariff filing regarding flexibility requirements and resource adequacy capacity.<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup></p>

                            <p>Summer, with its longer days and high temperatures, can bring some of the greatest challenges for grid operations. </p>
                            <p>For 2014, the ISO met the summer peak conditions across its balancing area despite a well-below average hydroelectric supply during one of the severest droughts on record.<sup><a href="foot2">2</a></sup></p>
                            <p>Average hourly hydro-electric production slipped 34 percent to 1,500 MW during the first nine months of 2014, compared to 2,300 MW for the same period in 2013. The decrease in hydro electricity was largely offset by solar generation. In the first nine months of this year, average hourly solar generation was up by 130% over last year.  For the first time, solar generation in September outpaced both hydro and wind production.</p>
                            <p>System-wide peak electric demand during summer 2014 reached 45,090 MW on September 15, which was about the same as in 2013. The all-time record peak demand was 50,270 MW in 2006.</p>

                            <p>The ISO did not have to use the Flex Alert tool in summer 2014 despite warmer than average temperatures and periods of high record setting loads in Southern California.  And even though the West and California suffered many wildfires, the number affecting the high voltage grid and tripping power lines off line, were limited this year. The San Diego County fires in mid-May triggered the yearâ€™s only transmission emergency as 14 blazes threatened high-voltage lines serving the area. Although there were several tense hours as the firestorms raged, grid operators from the ISO, working with San Diego Gas & Electric operators, managed to avoid electrical interruptions on the high-voltage grid.</p>

                            <p>Clean energy technologies, more efficient power plants and improvements to the transmission network are ushering in Californiaâ€™s new era of an environmentally focused power industry.</p>
                            <p>The pace of this rapid transformation to a greener grid also presents reliability challenges in Southern California, particularly since the early retirement of the 2,246 megawatt (MW) San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in June 2013. Combined with the regulatory timeline for phasing out 5,086 MW of aging gas-fired coastal power plants that use once-through cooling technology and increasing electricity demand from a modestly improving economy, grid reliability has become a more pronounced concern.</p>
                            <p>ISO grid planners, California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, transmission owners, generation owners and other stakeholders understand that successfully managing power demands in one of the stateâ€™s densest population corridors requires a plan that leads to long-term, cost-effective solutions. At the same time, replacing these lost megawatts creates opportunities for increasing deployment of preferred resources to ensure a sustainable, low-carbon energy future.</p>
                            <p>Together, the energy agencies and the ISO developed the <a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/2013-08-30_prelim_plan%5B2%5D.pdf" target="_blank">Preliminary Reliability Plan for the Los Angeles Basin and San Diego</a> <span class="nobr">(PDF, 191KB)</span> that outlines the issues, including work required to facilitate preferred resources and steps needed to strengthen the system and manage immediate power demands in the wake of the San Onofre retirement.</p>
                            <p>Not only was the nuclear plant the regionâ€™s largest electricity supplier, it also provided crucial voltage support along a critical transmission path, which is essential to the flow of power in the areaâ€™s already congested network.</p>
                            <p>Besides meeting 16 percent of the areaâ€™s energy needs, San Onofre also provided megavars (MVAR), also called reactive power, which acts like the pressure in a pipe to push electricity through transmission lines and keeps all the electrons humming along the wires.</p>
                            <p>One of the short-term contingency measures implemented to handle the summers of 2012 and 2013 included federal permission to install near zero-emission motors called synchronous condensers using retired equipment from the nearby Huntington Beach Power Plant. Although essential in the short run, these condensers cannot fully replace the 1,100 MVAR of voltage support that San Onofre provided. Additional voltage support was installed in southern Orange County and even more voltage support for the region was approved in the 2013-2014 Transmission Plan.</p>
                            <p>The actions to fortify the Southern California grid also furthers proactive environmental stewardship with a goal of using clean energy to fill as much as 50 percent of the void created from the unexpected loss of San Onofre.</p>

                            <p>The solutions will fortify existing transmission to create greater efficiencies in power flows while also taking into account an estimated 400 MW increase in demand each year through 2020. In addition, optimizing existing infrastructure helps avoid having to build new large and expensive power plants as well as enabling grid planners to consider distributed generation, such as demand response, as an alternative to natural gas plants.</p>

                            <p>Each year, the ISO presents to its Board of Governors a comprehensive assessment of the systemâ€™s transmission needs over the next 10 years. The Transmission Plan, which is developed over 15 months, identifies grid upgrades needed to successfully meet Californiaâ€™s policy goals, satisfy reliability requirements, or provide economic benefits to consumers. A key, overarching goal is to enable solutions that minimize greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                            <p>In addition to projects that support reliability needs, the current yearâ€™s plan (2013-2014) includes two policy driven projects to support renewable resources. A significant economic project, the Delaney-Colorado River line was approved by the ISO Board of Governors as an addendum to the 2013-2014 Transmission Plan. ISO analysis indicates the 115-mile line will relieve capacity issues on key transmission paths during peak demand periods and free up between 200 MW and 300 MW of line capacity from the Desert Southwest that can be re-purposed to increase import capacity from the Imperial Irrigation District â€” a ratepayer benefit estimated to be worth $26 million by 2018.</p>
                            <p>The upcoming 2014-2015 plan will address how to ensure that new generation in the Imperial Valley has the means to be delivered to the ISO grid or other balancing areas to address a power flow impact caused by closing the San Onofre power plant.</p>

                            <p>Californiaâ€™s forward-thinking energy policies embrace an aggressive strategy to power the Golden State with sustainable, natural energy sources and reduce greenhouse gases. A rainbow of clean energy sources â€” wind, solar, and eventually storage, combined with less carbon-intensive natural gas plants â€” are quickly replacing older, conventional power plants.  Indeed, by 2020, fully one-third of the stateâ€™s energy will come from preferred, cleaner, renewable resources â€” compared with just over one-tenth in 2009.<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup></p>
                            <p>But how do we make the switch to green power without sacrificing electric reliability?</p>
                            <p>The answer lies in carefully analyzing holistic approaches that meet operational challenges inherent with the variable nature of preferred resources, identifying infrastructure improvements that most efficiently deliver green power to where it needs to go, and creating market mechanisms to maximize use of preferred resources once they are built and ready for the grid.</p>
                        	<p>The good news is the ISO and the California Public Utilities Commission are working closely to develop the rules and requirements needed for flexible and cleaner resources to replace large-scale megawatt losses from aging fossil fuel plants and those forced into retirement by the stateâ€™s restrictions on using ocean and estuary water for cooling generation turbines. The commission ultimately ensures that sufficient capacity is available to meet system and local reliability requirements through its <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Procurement/RA/" target="_blank">resource adequacy program</a>, which requires utilities to procure in advance 100 percent of its forecasted demand plus an additional 15 percent.</p>
