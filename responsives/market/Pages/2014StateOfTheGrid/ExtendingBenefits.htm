                        <div class="block-content">
                            <p>As the transformation to a cleaner, more diversified energy future sweeps across California and its neighboring states, the benefits of sharing a larger resource area through regional collaboration makes sense.</p>
                            <p>Dispatching a broader array of resources with more precision creates greater efficiencies and increases system reliability. Currently, balancing areas only build and dispatch resources within their territory. But taking advantage of geographic diversity with an expanded real time spot market enables all market participants to create greater efficiencies by sharing existing resources. </p>
                            <p>On November 1, 2014, the ISO expanded its advanced, real-time energy dispatch services, or Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), to six states in the West with its first partner, Portland-based PacifiCorp.</p>
                            <p>The third largest utility in the West with more than 10,000 MW of peak load, PacifiCorp is the first to take advantage of this unique opportunity to augment regional reliability and further the integration of renewables.</p>
                            <p>This opportunity is not lost on others.</p>
                            <p>Las Vegas-based NV Energy quickly followed in PacifiCorp’s footsteps by announcing it was taking steps to join the EIM in October 2015 with about 7,500 MW of peak load.  NV Energy supplies power to most of Nevada.</p>

                    	<div class="block-content">
                            <p>The advantages of a real-time energy sharing market are numerous.</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><strong>Reliable and economic power.</strong> The EIM utilizes the ISO’s proven, scalable grid management system that matches demand with least-cost available generation resources in real time, thus reducing energy costs for customers.  It also means a participant, such as the ISO or PacifiCorp, would have less need to build new, expensive power plants as they can now draw upon resources throughout the West.</li>
                               <li><strong>Increased reliability, greater visibility.</strong> Taking advantage of the ISO’s sophisticated control center operations increases operational awareness and responsiveness to regional grid conditions, which, in turn, creates greater efficiencies in power delivery management.</li>
 								<li><strong>More renewable integration.</strong> Capturing the benefits of geographically diverse load and resources enables the output variation from wind and solar in one region to counterbalance variation in another.</li>  
                                <li><strong>Low cost.</strong> For PacifiCorp, conservative estimates for the 2017 participation year indicate the EIM would provide between $21 million to $129 million (2012$) in benefits from reduced energy curtailments, reduced reserve requirements as well as smoother inter- and intra-regional dispatch.<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>  A similar independent benefit assessment study found between $6 million and $10 million in benefits for NV Energy during 2017, <sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>  and an independent study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that sharing resources across the entire Western Interconnection could save more than a billion dollars annually. <sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>  
                            </ul>

                            <p>The Energy Imbalance Market is a voluntary, five-minute balancing market that adjusts to find the best resource to meet fluctuating demand across a larger region. More frequent power plant dispatching in real time better optimizes available energy supplies with actual energy demand.</p>
														
														<div class="callout nobg sc">
                            	<p>“The ISO is to be commended for conducting a thorough and meaningful stakeholder process to fully vet a market design that will bring numerous benefits to customers in California as well as the West.”  <span class="byline"><span class="cname">Bob Weisenmiller,</span><br />California Energy <span class="nobr">Commission Chair</span></span></p>
														</div>
														
                            <p>Key features of the market assure participants of the many benefits to be gained from more efficient use of the region’s diverse resources.</p>
                            <p><strong>It’s modern.</strong> The ISO’s high-technology control center automatically balances supply and demand every five minutes versus a manual hourly process still in use by non-ISO balancing areas across much of the West today. Dispatching energy every five minutes also helps keep up with constant fluctuations in wind and solar power.</p>
														
														<div class="callout nobg sc">
                            	<p>“The EIM is one of the most important non-legislative steps taken in years to increase the deployment of renewable power and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the West.” <span class="byline"><span class="cname">Carl Zichella,</span><br />Director of Western Transmission for the Natural Resources Defense Council</span></p>
														</div>
														
                            <p><strong>It’s cost-effective.</strong> Participating in the ISO’s sophisticated market platform requires only a modest set-up cost to unlock the value of efficient dispatching of regional resources.</p>
														
                            <p><strong>It’s voluntary.</strong> An EIM participant may choose to enter or exit the market at any time. </p>
														
														<div class="callout nobg sc">
                            	<p>“This is a vital opportunity for us and for the larger western grid as we look for ways to efficiently and more economically dispatch resources, optimize systems and integrate renewable power to the benefit of all customers.” <span class="byline"><span class="cname">Steve Berberich,</span><br />California ISO <span class="nobr">President and CEO</span></span> </p>
														</div>
														
                            <p><strong>It’s inclusive</strong>. The ISO’s Board of Governors approved a nine member Transitional Committee, with two additional seats reserved for PacifiCorp and NV Energy. This is the first step in establishing a governance framework to give EIM participants and other regional interests a voice in EIM decision making. A list of potential committee members were nominated and ranked by a broad cross-section of power industry representatives inside and outside of California. In May, the ISO Board of Governors <a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CaliforniaISOBoardAppointsCommittee_Advise_NewRegionalMarket.pdf" target="_blank">seated the final committee</a>  <span class="nobr">(PDF 76KB)</span> and a few weeks later its members nominated a chair.  In July, the Board accepted the nomination and appointed Commissioner Rebecca Wagner of the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada as <a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CaliforniaISOBoardConfirmsWagner_EIMAdvisoryCommitteeChair.pdf" target="_blank">committee chair</a> <span class="nobr">(PDF 290KB)</span>.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the ISO’s independent Department of Market Monitoring will assess EIM performance to assure the market design is working as intended and the market rules are being followed. The market monitor will address issues should they arise.</p>
                            <p>At the ISO, we are committed to ensuring reliable, yet economic power for consumers across the West.</p>
														
														<div class="callout nobg sc">
                            	<p>“Increased coordination of energy systems in the West is critical if we are to meet important challenges such as ensuring reliability, keeping costs down for customers and effectively integrating renewable resources.” <span class="byline"><span class="cname">Greg Abel,</span><br />PacifiCorp Chairman and CEO</span></p>
														</div>
														
                            <p>Using all of our assets to the most efficient level we can and ensuring the smooth integration of renewables in such a way that constrains costs and maintains reliability makes sense. And it’s as important to the rest of the greater West as it is to California.</p>
