                            <p><em>Imagine the possibilities.</em></p>
                            <p><em>Commercial electric vehicle fleets could charge at night by drawing from renewable energy resources, such as wind that blows mostly at night along the West Coast. Batteries store this lower-cost energy, then give it back to the grid during the day when the demand for electricity is high, thus providing another resource for grid operators to use in managing the grid in an efficient and flexible way.</em></p>

                        <p>Working with the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, California Air Resources Board, the Governor’s office, state utilities and others, the ISO published a roadmap in 2013 to develop the steps to realize the grid benefits of electric vehicles.</p>
                        <p>The <em>Vehicle-Grid Integration Roadmap: Enabling Vehicle-Based Grid Services</em>, a component of the Governor’s larger Zero Emission Vehicle Action <a href="http://www.opr.ca.gov/s_zero-emissionvehicles.php" target="_blank">Plan</a>, identifies three inter-dependent pathways for assessing how consumer use of electric vehicles can benefit electric reliability. The roadmap outlines how the ISO and the state’s energy agencies should focus their work in determining the policies and technologies necessary for electric vehicles to provide grid services while still meeting consumer driving needs.‬‬‬</p>
                        <p>Deploying smart charging strategies and vehicle–to-grid services includes establishing new market rules that create opportunities for consumers to eventually earn money selling energy back to the grid. All of this requires continued interagency and business partnerships that accelerate the development of vehicle-to-grid services through research projects and pilot programs to get the appropriate infrastructure and rules in place to support electric and hybrid vehicles. That’s the kind of living laboratory that balances the ever-changing needs of supply and demand and accommodates load growth while creating a more reliable and sustainable electric grid. ‬</p>

                            <p>In the never-ending race to match energy supply with constantly changing demand, speed and accuracy count.</p>
                            <p>Storage wins on both fronts. </p>
                            <p>Large-scale storage fits hand-in-glove with advancing the renewable energy goals by having the unique ability to store power when demand is low and providing it quickly when demand is high. The bi-directional characteristics of storage will be invaluable in countering fluctuations often associated with renewable power such as wind and solar.</p>
                            <p>Last year, the California Public Utilities Commission set an energy storage procurement target of 1,325 megawatts by 2020 for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric with installations completed by the end of 2024.</p>
                            <p>Stored energy’s benefits offer significant flexibility in balancing the power grid under a variety of conditions:</p>

                            <p>Several large-scale pilot programs are now underway across the state promise to increase the amount of storage used in grid operations. The Los Angeles Air Force Base project and the University of California’s San Diego microgrid, as well as pilots in the investor-owned utility areas, are providing the ISO with invaluable information on how these resources behave under real world conditions. In turn, the ISO and its partners can test different approaches to solving telemetry, interconnection, ramping, modeling, voltage support and frequency variations issues prior to full implementation.</p>

                            <p>In preparation for adding large-scale storage into grid operations, the ISO has implemented market and technology improvements to take advantage of technology’s flexible characteristics. A non-generator resource (such as batteries as opposed to a turbine generator that runs on fuel) designation now allows these fast-start resources to bid their capacity more effectively into the ISO’s voltage regulation markets. These resources — typically batteries, flywheels, aggregated electric vehicles and demand response — can help keep the grid in balance based on the resource’s ability to be dispatched in real time to any operating level within its capacity range.</p>
                            <p>Working with market participants, the ISO also updated common market and business systems software and technologies in the spring of 2013 to incent fast-starting resources to respond to ISO dispatch signals. Resources that respond with greater accuracy will receive higher payments.</p>
                            <p>And in another collaborative development, a new ISO <a href="http://www.caiso.com/informed/Pages/StakeholderProcesses/EnergyStorageInterconnection.aspx"  target="_blank">stakeholder forum</a> is addressing how best to connect storage to the grid. This initiative provides a forum for issue identification and solution development related to energy storage interconnection.  Short-term objectives focus on streamlining existing rules, as necessary, to bring the benefits of energy storage to the grid.</p>
                            <p>To help identify and prioritize issues, the ISO along with the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission are jointly producing an <a href="http://www.caiso.com/informed/Pages/CleanGrid/EnergyStorageRoadmap.aspx"  target="_blank">energy storage roadmap</a>, with its publication expected by the end of 2014. This effort kicked off on September 4 with the ISO hosting at its headquarters one of the largest stakeholder meetings in our history.</p>
                            <p>Leveraging thoughtful collaboration with industry partners and market participants, key policymakers and state agencies, the ISO continues to work on identifying how to integrate storage into wholesale grid operations that further strengthens reliability and supports a sustainable energy future.</p>

Demand response and load management help flatten spikes during high consumer use, which in turn helps bring down peak wholesale energy prices, while increasing consumption during times of abundant generation.</p>
                            <p>No one understands that better than the state of California. California consumers have been reducing environmental impacts for decades through improved building practices and appliance energy efficiency programs.</p>

                            <p>The state’s energy efficiency programs saved over 70,000 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2013.<sup><a href="#foot5">5</a></sup>  Meanwhile, California’s energy efficiency standards have saved more than $74 billion in reduced electricity bills since 1975.<sup><a href="#foot6">6</a></sup></p>
                            <p>Even more encouraging, recent technology trends and energy policy are enabling an evolutionary movement toward greater reliance on demand response and energy efficiency, as well as other forms of distributed energy resources such as microgrids, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and energy and thermal storage facilities.</p>
                            <p>The ISO believes implementing new more flexible and responsive resources will further advance goals to create a more reliable and cleaner power system in the West by contributing to the low-carbon flexible capacity needed to maintain real-time system reliability.</p>
                            <p>Demand response has significant untapped potential that includes being dispatchable and able to bid (aggregation) into the wholesale energy market. To better identify the policy and process activity needed to fully use demand response, the ISO in 2013 released a roadmap to point the way in building a more dynamic and diverse demand response market in the West.  Reflecting cross-agency coordination with the California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission throughout its development, the <a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/DR-EERoadmap.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Demand Response and Energy Efficiency Roadmap: Maximizing Preferred Resources</em></a> <span class="nobr">(PDF 3.7MB)</span>, lays out a vision for how utility demand response programs can participate in the wholesale markets and reduce the need to rely on fossil generation to fill in fuel gaps when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.</p>

                            <p>The nature of demand response and energy efficiency requires the ISO to think differently about how resources are planned and accounted for, and how they can best be procured to serve the needs of the ISO, market participants and consumers. For grid operations, increasing numbers of distribution-connected resources bring certain operational uncertainties, including the magnitude, type, timing, forecasting, and geographic distribution of these new energy resources. To help guide a smooth transition to a market for demand response and energy efficiency, the ISO’s roadmap identifies four integrated pathways, each with individual milestones, to support bringing on line a robust mix of distributed resources over the next few years.
